I'm pleased to announce that I'm going to be a Production Engineering intern at Facebook this upcoming summer! Production engineering is similar to DevOps at other companies, but with software engineering tasks, too. Although it's been over a month since my interviews, I hope I can leave a record of it to help future applicants while I still remember some fragments of it.

## The steps

The internship application process at Facebook is no short process. For the software engineering internship, there are 5 stages:

1. Application and Resume Submission
2. Leetcode Test
3. First Coding Interview
4. Second Coding Interview
5. Offer

And for the production engineering internship, there are also 5 stages:

1. Application and Resume Submission
2. Multiple-Choice Command-Line Test
3. Coding Interview
4. Systems Interview
5. Offer

## First Contact

I was very busy during the Fall quarter and didn't start applying to internships until very late, so I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get anything for the summer. Even though I had a significant amount of previous internship experience, many companies were scaling back their internship programs due to Coronavirus.

As such, I cast as wide of a net as possible and applied to many different companies of many different sizes. I hadn't been expecting much to come out of my application to Facebook's Software Engineering Internship, but I sent it anyways.

## A Coding Test

Then, in early January, a recruiter from reached out to me, and sent me a link to a LeetCode-style test with 4 questions. I don't recall what they were exactly, but there were 2 easy and 2 medium ones, going by LeetCode's difficulty rankings. I was able to solve the easy ones quite quickly, but I could only solve one of the medium ones perfectly. I could only figure out a suboptimal solution for the last one. Out of time, I submitted it and dejectedly waited for the response.

## A Command Line Test

In the meantime, a different recruiter found my resume on a different website, and reached out to me about applying to the Production Engineering Internship. I applied to that, and my task was to complete a 20-question quiz about the Linux command line.

I don't recall the specifics, but there were a lot of questions about very specific behaviors of Linux commands, that essentially boiled down to:

- What command do you use to check CPU/Memory/IO/Network/process data? No, `top` is not one of your choices.
- What combination of flags do you use to accomplish a certain task with this command? No, you may not `--help` or consult the `man` pages.

I'd consider myself familiar enough with the command line to do medium-complexity tasks in it, yet I did not know the answer to most of these questions.

## Results

Somehow, perhaps through sheer luck, I received word that I passed both tests, meaning it was time for my interviews! I'll go over those in my next blog post.
