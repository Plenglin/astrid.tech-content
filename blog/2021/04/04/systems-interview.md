## The Systems Interview

Now, this interview was _hard_. The other ones may have been a bit difficult, but at least I knew what I was doing! Here, I had literally no idea.

According to previous interviewees and Facebook's production engineering splash page, the Systems Interview covers, among other things:

- Linux/Unix: how it manages processes and memory and user-space and kernel-space and more!
- Databases, of SQL and NoSQL variety
- Networking
- Web services

I crammed very hard in the week and night before this interview, and when I showed up to the interview, I had no idea what I was doing.
