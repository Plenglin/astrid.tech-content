I feel like if computers didn't exist, I would have been a mathematician. But there's plenty of opportunities to embed fancy math inside a piece of code, and code can actually _do_ something, which is why I like programming and thus computers.

But when I was doing my college apps, I had the choice to either be a Computer Science (CS) major or a Computer Engineering (CPE) major. Although I do prefer software over hardware, I chose CPE at the time for the following reasons:

- I was in robotics and I liked it. Though I like high level stuff, I think low level stuff is also pretty interesting.
- I enjoy tinkering with electronics. Why not go for a major with both?
- It's probably slightly less impacted than CS. Still extremely impacted, but my chances are a bit better.

But now, I don't think I wanna do circuit analysis for another 2+ quarters. I mean, it's not even that I find it hard, I just find it rather tedious, and I'm really interested in software/theoretical stuff.

I feel like I should have considered switching earlier. When I saw the silicon manufacturing class on the CPE flowchart, I thought "eh, I don't think I want to go that low level, but oh well, I'll just take it." But I'm honestly not as interested in that as I am in the algorithms and stuff. I guess I'm more interested in the computers, not really the hardware. What I was _probably_ interested in was the microcontrollers and digital control systems, which are cool and they can interface with hardware. But again, that's a software problem and it's been quite abstracted from the hardware problem they originally are.

Computer Architecture was another class that was kind of holding me off on switching to CS, but I think I mostly enjoy it because it's mostly writing in HDL, which is again, more like coding than circuit/hardware design. Sure, it's a bit more complicated than C, for example, because you have to worry about propagation times and board resources. But even then, you're not making circuits, you're writing code. (As a side note, I've noticed that HDL and React are actually _really really_ similar in terms of the way of thinking. You must be wondering, _HDL, as low level as it gets, and React, as high level as it gets? How could that be?_ But that's a story for another time.)

I guess I just like high-level, more theoretical stuff. I'd rather take something more software-related, and maybe even get a math minor. There aren't as many available tech electives for CPE, even though I want to take a bunch of different tech electives. Also, I just personally feel like the major is weighted closer to EE than to CS than I would like.
