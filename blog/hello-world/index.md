Now that I think of it, this actually isn't too bad of an idea. By the time I finish this website, I will have a blog with actual content!

# Unfinished projects

Since I was a very very small human, like maybe 10 or so, I loved building and making things and using cool tech to make cool projects. However, it wasn't until maybe I was 15 or 16 that I was actually competent enough to make cool stuff.

Between then and now, I've done a ton of projects. Some were software, some were electronic, some were mechanical, and many were a combination of all 3. You can see the path of chaos and unfinished projects I left on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Plenglin?tab=repositories). But the problem is, **I always ended up getting halfway through and losing interest.** Also, I've ended up making so many projects, that **I've actually forgotten about most of them!**

# So why a personal website?

And **the bolded text** is the reason I'm making this website. When I work on a project, I'll spend some time writing a post here so that I have a record of what I'm doing. I may occasionally publish notes here as well, like for theoretical projects and thought experiments. Heck, if I ever feel like I'm knowledgeable enough, I may even post some tutorials!

Every project I work on will have its own page as sort of a general summary of what it is and why you should think it's cool, as well. All my new projects that aren't secret enough for hiding will be put on there. Also, I will slowly, over time, make pages for my old projects as I rediscover them.

# Wait, what's this about a redesign?

I'm glad you asked! This is not the first iteration of my website. Back in January 2020, I learned React as I began working on [Inventree](/projects/inventree). I was using vanilla JS around that time, and eventually, I lost steam on that project as I often do on many projects, so I took a break from it.

Then, I began working on the first iteration of this website in March. Again, I used vanilla JS, but later on, I thought, "Hey, what if I were to throw some TypeScript in here?" And so I did, and that was awesome, but converting all my components to TS was getting a bit boring, I lost steam on that, and I took a break again.

In May, I had a crazy big courseload, but towards the end, I was able to take some time out and work on Inventree again. I looked at my old React code, and immediately thougth, _wow, this looks like utter sh\*t._ I was really really bad at managing state. There were sketchy design choices. But of course, it's excusable, because it's only my first project.

So I scrapped it and started over again, but actually laying out the state on a piece of paper first. I even used some skills I learned in a computer design class! (Turns out React, which is as high level as it gets, has some really cool parallels with digital circuits, which are as low level as it gets! Stay tuned for more!)

Now, in June, I'm basically doing the same thing but with this website instead. Back in March, I wanted a static site and a blog in Markdown, but I couldn't figure out a really efficient way to do it using the tools provided by `create-react-app`. So, I thought, "I'm redesigning this thing, I might as well use Gatsby!" That brings us to now, where I'm trying to figure out how the hell I configure the static site configuration.
