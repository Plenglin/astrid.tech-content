I have a messy room with too many disorganized things in random places. This program will (hopefully) allow me, and maybe you if you want, to organize things at least a bit better.

# Technology Stack

## Backend

- Django and Python 3
- It's literally just a REST API

## Frontend

- React as the main frontend framework
- Axios for those API calls
- Typescript because I kinda like it when VSCode can give me suggestions for my massive objects
- Bootstrap to make things look fabulous
