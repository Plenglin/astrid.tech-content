This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Technology Stack

- Gatsby.js as the static site generator.
- React as the main frontend framework
- Typescript because I kinda like it when VS Code can give me suggestions for my massive objects
- Bootstrap to make things look nice
