<iframe src="https://astrid.tech" title="My website, but with recursion" width="300" height="250"></iframe>

This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Goals

- I want my website to represent my abilities and personality.
- I want my website to be accessible to those with disabilities. I use semantic tags as well as alt text on visual elements.
- I want my website to be responsive and mobile-friendly. The pages cannot be too large, and they must be usable on all resolutions and devices.

## Technology Stack

This website is statically generated!

### The site

- Typescript
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) as the static site generator.
- Bootstrap to make things look nice
- Jupyter notebooks for a few blog posts

### Deployment

- [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/plenglin/astrid.tech) to statically host the website.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/plenglin/astrid.tech/actions) to automatically build and publish the site on a push to the main branch.
