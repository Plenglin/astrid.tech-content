An IO-style game that involves cars crashing into each other.

The initial prototype was created during [HSHacks III](https://github.com/Plenglin/HSHacks-III) back in 2017 under the name of "High Octane Elastic Snowploughs." There were many incomplete rewrites of the project until eventually I completed this project in 2019.
